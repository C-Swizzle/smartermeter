      <h1>Getting Started With <a href="../classes/WWW/Mechanize.html">WWW::Mechanize</a></h1>
<p>
This guide is meant to get you started using Mechanize. By the end of this
guide, you should be able to fetch pages, click links, fill out and submit
forms, scrape data, and many other hopefully useful things. This guide
really just scratches the surface of what is available, but should be
enough information to get you really going!
</p>
<h2>Let&#8216;s Fetch a Page!</h2>
<p>
First thing is first. Make sure that you&#8216;ve required mechanize and
that you instantiate a new mechanize object:
</p>
<pre>
 require 'rubygems'
 require 'mechanize'

 agent = WWW::Mechanize.new
</pre>
<p>
Now we&#8216;ll use the agent we&#8216;ve created to fetch a page.
Let&#8216;s fetch google with our mechanize agent:
</p>
<pre>
 page = agent.get('http://google.com/')
</pre>
<p>
What just happened? We told mechanize to go pick up google&#8216;s main
page. Mechanize stored any cookies that were set, and followed any
redirects that google may have sent. The agent gave us back a page that we
can use to scrape data, find links to click, or find forms to fill out.
</p>
<p>
Next, lets try finding some links to click.
</p>
<h2>Finding Links</h2>
<p>
Mechanize returns a page object whenever you get a page, post, or submit a
form. When a page is fetched, the agent will parse the page and put a list
of links on the page object.
</p>
<p>
Now that we&#8216;ve fetched google&#8216;s homepage, lets try listing all
of the links:
</p>
<pre>
 page.links.each do |link|
   puts link.text
 end
</pre>
<p>
We can list the links, but Mechanize gives a few shortcuts to help us find
a link to click on. Lets say we wanted to click the link whose text is
&#8216;News&#8217;. Normally, we would have to do this:
</p>
<pre>
 page = agent.click page.links.find { |l| l.text == 'News' }
</pre>
<p>
But Mechanize gives us a shortcut. Instead we can say this:
</p>
<pre>
 page = agent.click page.link_with(:text =&gt; 'News')
</pre>
<p>
That shortcut says &quot;find all links with the name
&#8216;News&#8217;&quot;. You&#8216;re probably thinking &quot;there could
be multiple links with that text!&quot;, and you would be correct! If you
use the plural form, you can access the list. If you wanted to click on the
second news link, you could do this:
</p>
<pre>
 agent.click page.links_with(:text =&gt; 'News')[1]
</pre>
<p>
We can even find a link with a certain href like so:
</p>
<pre>
 page.links_with(:href =&gt; '/something')
</pre>
<p>
Or chain them together to find a link with certain text and certain href:
</p>
<pre>
 page.links_with(:text =&gt; 'News', :href =&gt; '/something')
</pre>
<p>
These shortcuts that mechanize provides are available on any list that you
can fetch like frames, iframes, or forms. Now that we know how to find and
click links, lets try something more complicated like filling out a form.
</p>
<h2>Filling Out Forms</h2>
<p>
Lets continue with our google example. Here&#8216;s the code we have so
far:
</p>
<pre>
 require 'rubygems'
 require 'mechanize'

 agent = WWW::Mechanize.new
 page = agent.get('http://google.com/')
</pre>
<p>
If we pretty print the page, we can see that there is one form named
&#8216;f&#8217;, that has a couple buttons and a few fields:
</p>
<pre>
 pp page
</pre>
<p>
Now that we know the name of the form, lets fetch it off the page:
</p>
<pre>
 google_form = page.form('f')
</pre>
<p>
Mechanize lets you access form input fields in a few different ways, but
the most convenient is that you can access input fields as accessors on the
object. So lets set the form field named &#8216;q&#8217; on the form to
&#8216;ruby mechanize&#8217;:
</p>
<pre>
 google_form.q = 'ruby mechanize'
</pre>
<p>
To make sure that we set the value, lets pretty print the form, and you
should see a line similar to this:
</p>
<pre>
 #&lt;WWW::Mechanize::Field:0x1403488 @name=&quot;q&quot;, @value=&quot;ruby mechanize&quot;&gt;
</pre>
<p>
If you saw that the value of &#8216;q&#8217; changed, you&#8216;re on the
right track! Now we can submit the form and &#8216;press&#8217; the submit
button and print the results:
</p>
<pre>
 page = agent.submit(google_form, google_form.buttons.first)
 pp page
</pre>
<p>
What we just did was equivalent to putting text in the search field and
clicking the &#8216;Google Search&#8217; button. If we had submitted the
form without a button, it would be like typing in the text field and
hitting the return button.
</p>
<p>
Lets take a look at the code all together:
</p>
<pre>
 require 'rubygems'
 require 'mechanize'

 agent = WWW::Mechanize.new
 page = agent.get('http://google.com/')
 google_form = page.form('f')
 google_form.q = 'ruby mechanize'
 page = agent.submit(google_form)
 pp page
</pre>
<p>
Before we go on to screen scraping, lets take a look at forms a little more
in depth. Unless you want to skip ahead!
</p>
<h2>Advanced Form Techniques</h2>
<p>
In this section, I want to touch on using the different types in input
fields possible with a form. Password and textarea fields can be treated
just like text input fields. Select fields are very similar to text fields,
but they have many options associated with them. If you select one option,
mechanize will deselect the other options (unless it is a multi select!).
</p>
<p>
For example, lets select an option on a list:
</p>
<pre>
 form.field_with(:name =&gt; 'list').options[0].select
</pre>
<p>
Now lets take a look at checkboxes and radio buttons. To select a checkbox,
just check it like this:
</p>
<pre>
 form.checkbox_with(:name =&gt; 'box').check
</pre>
<p>
Radio buttons are very similar to checkboxes, but they know how to uncheck
other radio buttons of the same name. Just check a radio button like you
would a checkbox:
</p>
<pre>
 form.radiobuttons_with(:name =&gt; 'box')[1].check
</pre>
<p>
Mechanize also makes file uploads easy! Just find the file upload field,
and tell it what file name you want to upload:
</p>
<pre>
  form.file_uploads.first.file_name = &quot;somefile.jpg&quot;
</pre>
<h2>Scraping Data</h2>
<p>
Mechanize uses <a href="http://nokogiri.rubyforge.org/">nokogiri</a> to
parse html. What does this mean for you? You can treat a mechanize page
like an nokogiri object. After you have used Mechanize to navigate to the
page that you need to scrape, then scrape it using nokogiri methods:
</p>
<pre>
  agent.get('http://someurl.com/').search(&quot;.//p[@class='posted']&quot;)
</pre>
